## General Information

* SVG files minify by [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) project with max optimize;
* PNG files have `600x600` size and `transparent` background.

### History and main idea

The meaning of the logo is quite simple: ascending (read, like new) bright star, which shines brightly. Good typography for merchandising and speeches at Python conferences, catchy graphics for everything else.

> Yes, I know, starlette is a French word and literally means rising star, english equivalent of a starlet, but with a different meaning :)

The small star is directed slightly up and to the right to show the dynamics of movement, but not to be super intrusive.
